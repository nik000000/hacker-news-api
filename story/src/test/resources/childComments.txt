We have subway lines &amp; trains wired up for 1 man operation but run them staffed with 2 due to union work rules.<p>We have for years instead of building elevators, paid 3rd party access-a-ride minibus&#x2F;van drivers to provide Uber-like service to anyone in need.<p>We are planning to spend something like $3B&#x2F;mile to expand a single train line a few stops further north.<p>The MTA estimates they can put in platform doors like other developed world cities in only 1&#x2F;3 of stations, at an average cost of $50M&#x2F;station.<p>We spent something close to $10B building an entire new terminal for LIRR underneath an existing Metro North terminal when there was enough capacity to serve both out of the existing station.  Bureaucratic squabbles between divisions of MTA serving LI &amp; NY&#x2F;CT were mitigated by spending $10B.  Oh and for the average LIRR rider, despite having 2 Manhattan terminals they can get a train to, the net service has actually been reduced in terms of trains per day.<p>We basically need a modern era Robert Moses to consolidate NYC DOT&#x2F;MTA&#x2F;Port Authority and whatever other agencies and bring us into the modern era.",

The individualistic personal freedom of the automobile doesn&#x27;t outweigh those practical aspects of getting around. People generally make pretty logical decisions about what they want to do.<p>I&#x27;m definitely in favor of congestion charges in certain areas of NYC. If you&#x27;re downtown in a car you are taking up some incredibly valuable real estate that could be alternatively dedicated to space for human beings.<p>I think about cities that have implemented taxes for disposable plastic bags. I find it somewhat hilarious how many people consider these policies to be anti-freedom government money-grabs. They make a libertarian&#x27;s blood boil!<p>Even assuming those folks are correct, it doesn&#x27;t really matter, because these taxes are incredibly effective. It&#x27;s  eye-opening to see how a nearly insignificant tax (literal pennies per bag) changes the behavior of <i>everyone</i>.<p>In cities with bag taxes, cashiers don&#x27;t default to throwing your stuff in a bunch of bags, they ask you what you want first. Without the bag tax, some people who don&#x27;t even have a strong preference to receive bags will end up with them just because the cashier put their items inside automatically. Then, customers start bringing their own reusable bags, use their existing backpacks and totes that they already own, and&#x2F;or people will just carry a few items without a bag. The end result that the tax was going for has occurred regardless of how mad the individualists get: thousands of single-use disposable items stay out of landfills.<p>This is the same idea for congestion charges: people in NYC who might default to taking an Uber or taxi to get somewhere that&#x27;s often the same speed or faster to get to on a subway or bus are going to think twice, because there&#x27;s the psychological knowledge that their behavior is being punished, even if only by a few dollars or cents.",
